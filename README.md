# Bitcoin design

I have been focused on helping improve design in the bitcoin ecosystem full-time since July 2020, made possible by the friendly people of [Square Crypto](https://squarecrypto.org). Before that I've worked in digital design since 2004 and contributed to the design of the Monero GUI since late 2017. For more background, see my [website](https://www.germanysbestkeptsecret.com). My goal is to collaborate directly with projects on their design neeeds, and also help promote design in the cryptocurrency space overall, as well as helping other designers find their way around this exciting area.

I try to regularly share by-products of my work. Here are a few places:

- [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gbks) for random snippets
- [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/GBKS) for the occasional glamour shot
- [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4hsXZYKTCz15guoMZUumWVlL79NlrXYO) with occasional video updates
- [Shared images folder](/shared-images) with diverse mockups I share with others

## The bitcoin design community

Founded in mid 2020, a community has formed on [Slack](http://bitcoindesigners.org) and [Github](https://github.com/bitcoindesign) to collaborate on improving the user experience of bitcoin. I help structure and organize the community by [organizing calls](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Meta/issues), helping with a [bitcoin design newsletter](https://bitcoindesign.substack.com), being a Github repo maintainer, helping with development of the website and various other organizational things. It's awesome. You should join.

## The bitcoin design guide

The first big project of the bitcoin design community ([repo](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Guide)), this is an effort to help designers in the bitcoin space by providing documents and resources. This includes introductions to the most important topics, to best practices, UI kits, and more. I am focused on the "Getting started" section and overall coordination of the guide effort. Review and help on the guide is super highly appreciated. Check the preview link below and leave your comments on the linked pull request. If you don't like Github, ping me on [Slack](http://bitcoindesigners.org) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gbks).

## Multisig wallets

Self-custody of larger amounts of bitcoin is still a complex task that requires technical knowledge. I am working on finding ways to simplify and streamline the user experience of multisig wallets, as they require more complex technical setups for users to manage, as well as interactions between multiple participants. This work is still pretty early. Lots of research to do and things to figure out.
